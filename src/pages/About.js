                        I'm a web developer based in Wroc≈Çaw. I specialise in designing and building sites. My adventure with programming started in 2018 and it became my biggest goal in life since then. My main focus lies on the JavaScript, React, Angular development and Front-end.
                        I also have a commercial exprecience, it helped me to develop my programming skills in JS, AngularJS and a little bit in PHP. Now I keep learning JS frameworks, Typesciprt and Node.js, and create my own projects and projects with other programmers too.
